simple qt app that writes to Qtextedit at a user defined rate. This was created because we are having issues when updating this QTextedit. After many hours it takes longer and longer to write to the screen.

at 100 hz it takes about 15 minutes to see the issue

at 10 hz it makes about 1 hours to see the issue

at 1 hz it takes about a 6 hr to see the issue
